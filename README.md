# Music_Database
The project is my attempt at highlighting my SQL Skills. I have tried to showcase skills like JOINS, Window Function, Aggregations, Case, Date, Groupby, etc.

## About the data
The data comes from an SQL instructor. It was an SQL file and is a combination of multiple CSV files. There are 11 tables:
1. album
2. artist
3. customer
4. employee
5. genre
6. invoice
7. invoice_line
8. media_type
9. playlist
10. playlist_track
11. track
The data didn't need much cleaning, There were not many null values and all the data types were correct.

## Summary
I have tried to answer various questions related to sales. Some of the key questions include:
1. Which artist sold the most songs
2. Countries with the highest sales.
3. Most popular genre,
4. Analysis of the customer information.

## Attached Files.
I will attach an SQL file, a report based on my findings, and a presentation showing my conclusions.
